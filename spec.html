    <h1>What is your website about?</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      I am part of an organization on campus called Business Finance Association. Within
      this organization, I am part of the Babson Financial Literacy Project as a Internal 
      Planning Director. As an organization, we host events at schools within underserved communities 
      to spread awareness about financial knowledge and education. We currently don't have a website to share with others the purpose/vision
      of our project, the organizations we are working with, upcoming events, past events, 
      and a timeline for how students who are interested in our project should get involved.
      I would want to create a website detailing all this information.
    </p>
    <h1> What is the objective of your website?</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        The purpose of this website is as an organization we have a lot of information but 
        we don't have any way to share it to a large mass of people in a condensed way. 
        Hopefully, this website will be a useful tool for students of Babson to access
        information about the organization easily.
    </p>
    <h1> Who is your target audience?</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
       My target audience would be Babson College Students (freshmen to seniors) who want to become
       a financial wellness trainer, schools who would be interested in incorporating financial 
       wellness sessions for their students, and nonprofit organizations who want to collaborate with 
       us as they align with our vision.
    </p>
    <h1>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Aside from homepage, sitemap, and contact feedback pages, I would have the following pages: 
        <ul>
          <li>For Students: How to become a Financial Wellness Trainer</a></li>
          <li>For Schools: How to get involved and your role</li>
          <li>For Nonprofit Organizations: How to get involved for collaborations and your role</li>
          <li>Upcoming Events/Past Events</li>
          <li>Financial Wellness Concepts being Taught/more information about the curriculum</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
